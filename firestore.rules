    /**
     * CORE PHILOSOPHY
     * This ruleset implements a strict path-based ownership model for the Inventário Fácil application. 
     * Security is centered around the Firebase Authentication UID, ensuring that users can only 
     * access data within their own dedicated tree (/users/{userId}/...).
     * 
     * DATA STRUCTURE
     * The database follows a hierarchical user-centric structure:
     * - /users/{userId}: Profile information for the authenticated user.
     * - /users/{userId}/inventories/{inventoryId}: Private inventory documents owned by the user.
     * 
     * KEY SECURITY DECISIONS
     * 1. Path-Based Authorization: We rely on the {userId} wildcard in the path to authorize 
     *    requests, matching it against the request.auth.uid. This provides high performance by 
     *    avoiding cross-document lookups (get() calls).
     * 2. Strict Privacy: There are no public collections. Users cannot list or read other users' profiles.
     * 3. Relational Integrity: On creation of a user profile, we enforce that the 'id' field within 
     *    the document matches the document ID and the user's authenticated UID.
     * 4. Prototyping Flexibility: While ownership is strictly enforced, the specific data fields 
     *    (schema) within inventory documents are flexible to allow for "Customizable Data Entry."
